    Usage: spl-js-engine [validate] [--option value] ...

    Validate option is still at BETA (only works properly for features and simple data, not collections). When selected, the product is validated before being generated.

    General options:
      --help            # Print this info and generator's options and usage
      --version         # Print version?
      --featureModel    # [Required] Path to the feature model representation
                            (json, yaml or xml).
      --product         # Path to the product specification (json or yaml).
      --config          # Path to the platform configuration (json or yaml).
      --extra           # Path to the extra js file
      --code            # [Required] Path to the annotated code.
      --output          # Path to the output folder of the product. Default is
                            'output'.
